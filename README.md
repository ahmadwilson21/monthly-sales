# monthly-sales
Environment Setup

Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:

conda create -n sales-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate sales-env

From within the virtual environment, install any packages you think you'll need:

pip install pandas # (only if you're using pandas to parse the CSV files)

From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

python reporter.py

If you see the "GENERATING SALES REPORT FOR MONTH OF OCTOBER 2013..." message, you're ready to move on to project development. This would be a great time to make any desired modifications to your project's "README.md" file (like adding instructions for how to setup and run the app like you've just done), and then make your first commit, with a message like "Setup the repo".
